                                <p>Before starting the website, we individually finished required courses from “codeacademy”. Secondly, we tried to combine the knowledge we learned from the courses as a group and help each other in difficulties. Then we started building the site with all the knowledge we have learned from “codeacademy” course. We used programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the website. Moreover, we made some mistakes while building the website, but then we were able to overcome obstacles. We have opened different sections on our website, such as "hour of code", "robotics project", "information about ourselves" and wrote certain information about them. Finally, we surrounded the website with images and videos, which make the site look more attractive.

                            <p>The Hour of Code started as a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to clarify 
                                "code", to show that everybody can learn the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. Since then, it has been a global movement to celebrate computer science, 
                                beginning with 1-hour coding operations but extending to all kinds of group projects. Anyone can organize an Hour of Code event, anywhere in the world. For these reasons, we also participated in the Hour of Code event in order to introduce computer science to young aged school children. Our “hour of code” organization aimed to introduce school kids to the fundamentals of computer science and programming and to interest them in this area. The event was held online via the“zoom” website, with 5th-grade students of Zangilan (Karabakh) secondary school No.33. 
                                The total number of event participants was 20. First, we started by informing them about the ADA
                                 university and the general information about  "hour of code". Then we demonstrated encouraging videos to make our event enthusiastic. Three different and interesting games were demonstrated to help children understand the basic structure of the field. The kids enjoyed the games and told us that they got valuable information about technology and programming. In the end, the students were certified for their active participation in the event.
